## Web Scraping Projects: Hacker News & IMDb Top Movies
This repository contains two web scraping projects designed to extract structured, meaningful datasets from popular websites:

1. Hacker News Scraper
Hacker News is a hub for the tech community, featuring real-time discussions on startups, programming, and emerging technologies. In this project, I’ve scraped article titles, points (upvotes), authors, and comment counts to build a dataset that reflects trending topics and user engagement on the platform.

2. IMDb Top Movies Scraper
IMDb hosts one of the most comprehensive and authoritative databases of movies. This scraper targets IMDb’s Top 250 movies list, extracting key details such as movie titles, release years, ratings, directors, and lead actors — providing a dataset useful for film analytics, recommendation systems, and data visualization.

🔍 Objective
The aim of these projects is to practice web scraping techniques using Python, and to transform unstructured web content into datasets that can be used for exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning experiments. Both projects are implemented in Google Colab notebooks for ease of access and reproducibility.
